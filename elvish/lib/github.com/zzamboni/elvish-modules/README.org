This Elvish package contains various modules I have written for the [[https://elv.sh/][Elvish shell]]. [[https://github.com/zzamboni/elvish-themes/][Themes]] and [[https://github.com/zzamboni/elvish-completions][completions]] are kept in separate packages.

* Installation

To install, use [[https://elvish.io/ref/epm.html][epm]]:

#+begin_src elvish
  use epm
  epm:install github.com/zzamboni/elvish-modules
#+end_src

For each module you want to use, you need to add the following to your =rc.elv= file:

#+begin_src elvish
  use github.com/zzamboni/elvish-modules/<modulename>
#+end_src

See each module's page for detailed usage instructions.
